# Feature Specification: LinkedIn Cold Outreach AI Assistant

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "this is a google chrome extension that is a Agent help you analyse the target sending cold message with your own info, can be use on social media (Linkedin for MVP)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Profile Analysis and Message Generation (Priority: P1)

A user visits a LinkedIn profile of a potential contact they want to reach out to. They activate the extension, which analyzes the target's profile (job title, company, recent posts, mutual connections) and generates a personalized cold message draft using the user's own background information (stored in their profile).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the extension - enabling users to quickly create personalized outreach messages without manually researching each profile. This delivers immediate value and can be tested independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the extension, navigating to any LinkedIn profile, clicking the extension icon, and verifying that a personalized message draft is generated based on both the target's and user's information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing a LinkedIn profile with complete information (job title, company, experience), **When** they activate the extension, **Then** the extension displays an analysis of the target including their role, company, and key interests
2. **Given** the extension has analyzed a target profile, **When** the user requests a message draft, **Then** a personalized cold message is generated that references specific details from both the target's profile and the user's stored information
3. **Given** a generated message draft, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** they can see which elements came from the target's profile (highlighted or annotated) and which came from their own profile

### User Story 2 - User Profile Setup and Management (Priority: P2)

A user installs the extension for the first time and needs to provide their own background information (professional background, current role, what they're looking for, value proposition) so the AI can personalize messages appropriately. They can update this information at any time.

**Why this priority**: This is a prerequisite for generating personalized messages, but comes second because without P1, there's no value delivered. Users need to configure their profile once before they can use the core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by installing the extension, accessing the settings/profile page, entering personal information (bio, current role, goals), saving it, and verifying the information persists across browser sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has just installed the extension, **When** they first activate it, **Then** they are prompted to set up their profile with essential information (name, current role, background, outreach goals)
2. **Given** a user has entered their profile information, **When** they save it, **Then** the information is stored securely and persists across browser sessions
3. **Given** a user wants to update their information, **When** they access the extension settings, **Then** they can view, edit, and save changes to their profile at any time
4. **Given** a user has incomplete profile information, **When** they try to generate a message, **Then** they receive a clear notification about which information is missing and how it impacts message quality

### User Story 3 - Message Customization and Export (Priority: P3)

After the AI generates a cold message draft, the user wants to customize it further, adjust the tone or length, and then easily copy it to send via LinkedIn messaging or InMail.

**Why this priority**: While important for user control and flexibility, this enhances the basic functionality of P1. Users can still get value from P1 even with basic copy functionality, making this a lower priority enhancement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a message (from P1), using editing tools to modify tone/length, and copying the result to LinkedIn messaging, verifying the format is preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a generated message draft, **When** the user selects a different tone option (professional, casual, enthusiastic), **Then** the message is regenerated with the selected tone while maintaining personalization
2. **Given** a generated message draft, **When** the user adjusts the length slider (short, medium, long), **Then** the message content is adapted to the selected length
3. **Given** a finalized message, **When** the user clicks the copy button, **Then** the message is copied to clipboard in a format ready to paste into LinkedIn messaging
4. **Given** a customized message, **When** the user manually edits text in the draft, **Then** their edits are preserved and not overwritten by subsequent AI adjustments

### User Story 4 - Batch Analysis and Campaign Tracking (Priority: P4)

A user who regularly sends cold messages wants to analyze multiple LinkedIn profiles in sequence, keep track of who they've contacted, and see which generated messages they've already sent to avoid duplicate outreach.

**Why this priority**: This is a power-user feature that enhances productivity for frequent users but isn't necessary for the MVP. Users can get value from single-profile analysis first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by analyzing multiple profiles in succession, sending messages, and verifying that the extension displays history and prevents duplicate contact attempts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has contacted someone via the extension, **When** they visit that person's profile again, **Then** the extension displays a notification showing when they last contacted them and what message was sent
2. **Given** a user views their extension dashboard, **When** they access the outreach history, **Then** they see a list of all analyzed profiles, generated messages, and contact dates
3. **Given** a user has contacted someone within the past 30 days, **When** they try to generate a new message for that person, **Then** they receive a warning about recent contact to prevent spam-like behavior

- How does the extension behave on LinkedIn pages that aren't individual profiles (company pages, job postings)?
- What happens when LinkedIn's page structure changes and profile elements can't be located?
- How does the extension handle rate limiting or throttling from LinkedIn?
- What happens when the user has no internet connection while trying to generate a message?
- How does the system handle very long profiles with extensive experience histories?
